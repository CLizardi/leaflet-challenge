# Introduction:

In this project, I created a web map using Leaflet.js to visualize earthquake data. The data was obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and was updated every 5 minutes. The map shows the locations of earthquakes on a map based on their latitude and longitude, and the size and color of the markers represent the magnitude and depth of the earthquake, respectively. Popups were also included to provide additional information about each earthquake when the marker is clicked. Additionally, a legend was created to provide context for the map data.

# Tools Used:

Leaflet.js: A popular open-source JavaScript library for creating interactive maps.
D3.js: A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.
GeoJSON: A format for encoding geographic data structures.
JavaScript: A programming language used to create interactive web pages.
What I Learned:

Through this project, I gained experience with using Leaflet.js to create web maps. I learned how to import and visualize GeoJSON data using Leaflet.js, how to create different types of map layers and markers, and how to add interactivity to the map through popups and legends. I also learned how to use D3.js to manipulate data and create color scales based on the depth of the earthquakes.

# How These Tools Can be Beneficial:

Leaflet.js and D3.js are powerful tools for creating interactive and visually appealing maps. These tools can be used for a variety of applications, such as data visualization, tracking events in real-time, and creating interactive educational resources. By using these tools, it is possible to create highly customizable and interactive maps that can be used for a variety of purposes.
